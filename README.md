# Project：Would You Rather

Would you rather is a ReactJS app that allows a user to login, ask and answer different poll questions. It will also show a leaderboard based on the number of questions each user has asked and answered.

The primary purpose for developing Would You Rather was to gain exposure to React Router & Redux, thus core functionality such as user authentication and the project backend is mocked.
